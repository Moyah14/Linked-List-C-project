Linked List Memory Management Explanation
=========================================

Memory Management in Linked List Operations:

The linked list implementation manages memory dynamically using the heap. Each node is allocated with 'new' and contains a value and pointer to the next node. The head pointer tracks the first node, while each node points to its successor, creating a chain structure.

Key memory management principles:
1. Dynamic Allocation: Nodes are created on-demand using 'new Node(value)', storing data and next pointer
2. Pointer Navigation: The list traverses by following next pointers from head to null
3. Safe Deletion: The destructor systematically deletes all nodes by traversing the chain and freeing each node with 'delete'
4. Memory Leak Prevention: Copy constructor and assignment operator are deleted to prevent shallow copies that could cause double-deletion
5. Exception Safety: Operations check bounds and handle empty lists gracefully to prevent accessing invalid memory

This approach ensures efficient memory usage while maintaining data integrity and preventing memory leaks through proper cleanup procedures.
